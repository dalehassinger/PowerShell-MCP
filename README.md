# PowerShell-MCP:

A PowerShell MCP Server to integrate with **Claude Desktop**.

All the code is 100% PowerShell.  

---

## Overview:

This project was originally created during the **2025 VMware Explore Hackathon**.  

Special thanks to **Don Horrox** and **Amos Clerizier** for their collaboration—sharing ideas, writing code, and being great teammates. The past two years of Hackathons together have been as much about building friendships as building projects.  

---

## Goals:

- **100% PowerShell** implementation — no external runtimes.
- **High reusability** of existing **PowerCLI** scripts with minimal changes (ideally just imports/parameter tweaks/return results as json).
- **First-class prompting** for **VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF)** products (e.g., vCenter, NSX, vSAN, Aria Operations).
- **On the fly** reports without generating any code to create the results

## Getting Started:

To connect this PowerShell MCP Server with Claude Desktop, include a configuration entry similar to the example below:

```json
// claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "powershell-mcp": {
      "command": "pwsh",
      "args": [
        "-File",
        "path/to/PowerShell-MCP.ps1"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Example json file in the code.  

## Project Structure:

To keep the MCP Server script clean, all **Tools** (PowerShell functions) are stored in a dedicated `tools` subfolder.  
When the server runs, it automatically loads every tool (*.ps1 file) defined in that folder.  

All **configuration details** required for the tools to connect to their respective products are stored in the `mcp-config.yaml` file, located in the `config` subfolder.

Sample **Prompts** will be located in the `prompts` subfolder.  

Example **Prompt Results** will be located in the `Prompt-Results` subfolder.

## PowerShell Modules used with the MCP code and Tools:  

* PowerCLI  
* ImportExcel  
* powershell-yaml  
* Posh-SSH  

## Tools:

In the `tools` folder are functions that I used in my Lab to prompt against the following:

* VMware vCenter
* VCF Operations
* Network Switch
* Create DNS Records
* Send email
* Create MD Tables
* Create html reports in the style of VCF Operations
* If you can script it, you can prompt it!
